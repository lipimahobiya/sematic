            <h1>Flower</h1>
            <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
            division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect the
            developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in
            flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced
            in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.
            
            Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
            different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored,
            conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[1] In this way, many
            flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in
            the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[2]
            
            When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may
            self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to
            prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the
            stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the
            stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This
            pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[3] Some
            flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops
            into fruit containing seeds.</p>
